As an innovative thinker, I chose computer science to bring my ideas to life, ideas that continually inspire and drive me forward. With over 1,000 hours dedicated to refining and developing these concepts, I am eager to deliver unique, impactful solutions through versatile and robust platforms. My areas of interest span Full Stack Development, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, and I am committed to leveraging these skills to craft exceptional digital experiences.


I'm always eager to collaborate on new projects and take on challenging tasks that offer valuable learning opportunities and growth.
